Successful data acquisition is only the tip of the iceberg over the lifetime of ERDL projects. Long-term maintenance often relies on data issues beyond code logic, including outages, change of environmental conditions, remote sensor network availability, incorrect configuration and sensor lifetime. We maintain notebooks and visualizations to monitor for data inconsistencies continually.
