The **Environmental Research and Design Laboratory (ERDL)**, an inter-disciplinary research laboratory located in the School of Architecture at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, was formed to advance sustainable design through research, education, and community outreach. ERDL aims to improve the dynamic interaction among the built, natural, and human environments by supporting the teaching mission of the School, the local community, and the State of Hawai‘i.

To support its vision, ERDL actively and openly maintains a suite of tools for sensor and survey data acquisition, data quality control, and thermal comfort modeling. This website provides an overview of the existing tools and their code on GitHub.
